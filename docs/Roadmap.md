# Dotfilet Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and enhancements for Dotfilet beyond the initial implementation.

## Future Features

### Configuration Import

- Auto-import the user's current system and program configuration when running `dotfilet init`

### Application Management

- **Package Manager Integration**: Coordinate with package managers (e.g. Homebrew) to install/uninstall applications when they are configured.

- **Multi-Platform Package Managers**: Extend support to other package managers (nix, etc) for broader ecosystem compatibility.

## Implementation Priorities

These features are not yet prioritized and will be evaluated based on user feedback and implementation complexity during development.
