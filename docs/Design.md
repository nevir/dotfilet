# Dotfilet Design Document

This document outlines the vision, architecture, and core concepts for Dotfilet, a declarative configuration management tool for macOS (and potentially other operating systems in the future).

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles

Dotfilet aims to be the **definitive tool for developers** to manage their entire macOS environment declaratively. It treats your machine's configuration as code, allowing it to be versioned, shared, and reliably reproduced across multiple machines.

- **Declarative:** You define the _desired state_ of your system in a config file; Dotfilet figures out how to make it so.

- **Bi-directional Sync is Key:** Unlike most tools, Dotfilet isn't a one-way street. It can **read changes** made manually via GUI or CLI and help you commit them back to your configuration, preventing drift and making it the single source of truth.

- **Extensible by Design:** A robust plugin system is fundamental, allowing the community to add support for any application or aspect of the system.

- **Ergonomics First:** The configuration language and CLI should be intuitive for developers, with great IDE support and clear feedback.

## 2. Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding these terms is key to the Dotfilet architecture.

- **Plugin:** A self-contained module responsible for managing a single application (e.g., vscode, macos-dock, git). Each plugin knows how to read, write, and validate the configuration for its target.

- **Configuration:** The set of files written by the user that declare the desired state of their system.

- **State:** The final, merged configuration object that represents the complete desired state for a machine.

- **Variable/Secret:** A value that can be injected into the configuration from an external source (e.g., an environment variable, a 1Password vault).

## 3. User Experience (UX) & Configuration

### 3.1. CLI Commands

The primary interface is the Dotfilet CLI.

#### `dotfilet init`

Scaffolds a new Dotfilet repository with a sample structure. May ask the user a few questions to customize the environment appropriately.

#### `dotfilet diff`

Reads the current state of the system and displays any changes that it would like to make.

Important flags & arguments:

- `[...resources]`: The user can pass specific resources like `program.vscode` or `macos.security`, or even specific settings like `macos.dock.autohide` to restrict the set of changes to be considered.

- `--plan [PLANFILE]`: Instructs `dotfilet diff` to write its plan to disk.

#### `dotfilet apply`

Applies the configuration from the repo to the local machine. Also implicitly associates and then starts the sync agent.

Important flags & arguments:

- `[...RESOURCES]`: The user can pass specific resources like `program.vscode` or `macos.security`, or even specific settings like `macos.dock.autohide` to restrict the set of changes to be considered.

- `--plan [PLANFILE]`: Consumes a plan file (generated by diff) and applies only those changes.

#### `dotfilet agent associate`

Configures the sync agent to use the configuration located in the current directory (or passed path).

#### `dotfilet agent start`

Starts the sync agent; installing it if needed.

#### `dotfilet agent stop`

Stops the sync agent.

#### `dotfilet agent install`

Installs configuration (e.g. launchd) for the agent to be persistent.

#### `dotfilet agent uninstall`

Removes the agent’s installed configuration.

### 3.2. Core Configuration Schema

[The core configuration schema is defined in the `Configuration-Schema.md` document.](./Configuration-Schema.md)

Misc decisions / thoughts:

- CUE is the configuration language
- Configuration ultimately compiles down to one big JSON object
  - So that lets most of dotfilet bet agnostic to CUE; and also support other tools that just spit out the final JSON

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1. Sync Agent

[Details to be added from #8](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/8)

### 4.2. Plugin Architecture

Misc decisions / thoughts:

- Plugins are external processes
- Plugins communicate with dotfilet via JSON-RPC

### 4.3. Variables & Secrets

[Details to be added from #10](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/10)

Misc decisions / thoughts:

- Variables are context
  - Hostname
  - Etc
- Variables should be persisted if we prompt the user for them
- Secrets:
  - Must be represented via some special string tokens `<<1pass:secret_id>>`(?) that gets interpolated.
  - Secrets mean there is some sense of dependency resolution required (e.g. cannot sync configuration that relies on vars/secrets until they are present on the system. E.g. cannot use 1password secrets until 1Password is installed / configured)
  - We need some way to wait for the user to configure/unlock these tools
  - Plugins need some way to provide secrets (and other variables?)
  - Are secrets just specially managed variables?

### 4.4. Configuration Writeback

Misc decisions / thoughts:

- Convention over configuration
  - Rely on a standard .cue file structure to write back to that by default
  - If the convention can’t be followed, have some failsafe (“overrides.cue” or something?)

## 5. Protocols

### 5.1. Plugin JSON-RPC Protocol

[Details to be added from #12](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/12)

Misc:

- Document similarly to the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
- Only websocket? Support both websocket + synchronous?

Methods (names TBD):

- Server -> Plugin:
  - `describeConfig`: Reports all known supported configuration values and their ranges (as JSON schema? CUE schemata?)
  - `getConfig`: Retrieves the current (remote) configuration; possibly with a narrowed set of config values
  - `applyConfig`: Idempotently applies the requested configuration.
  - `subscribeToRemoteChanges`: Requests that the plugin watch for changes and report them back via `remoteChanges` messages.
  - `fileSystemChanges`: Reports any files that have changed and the matching expression(s) that were subscribed to.
- Plugin -> Server:
  - `remoteChanges`: Sends any configuration values that were changed out of band.
  - `subscribeToFilesystem`: Asks the server to perform file system watching on specific paths

## 6. Security

### 6.1. Security Model

[Details to be added from #14](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/14)

## 7. Error Handling & Reporting

[Details to be added from #11](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/11)

## 8. Appendix

### 8.1. Plugin Prototype Ideas

[Details to be added from #13](https://github.com/nevir/dotfilet/issues/13)

### 8.2. Open Questions

- Managed applications
  - Should be able to manage application installation via homebrew
  - ^ If someone removes a managed application from the configuration, we should uninstall it
  - Leave room to support other package managers (nix, etc)
