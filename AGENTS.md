## Development Workflow

> [!WARNING]
>
> This workflow MUST be followed for every task. Failure to follow this workflow, especially creating a branch before making changes, will result in rejected modifications.

### MANDATORY Steps (In Order):

1. **ðŸ“– Read & Understand**: Thoroughly review the GitHub issue and all comments first.

   - If it's a sub-issue, review the parent issue and related sub-tasks.
   - Formulate an initial to-do list of the steps you think you need to accomplish the task.
     - If you have a built-in task tracking tool, use that.
     - Otherwise, write your to-do list to a file
   - **NO file system modifications during this step.**

2. **ðŸŒ¿ Create Branch**: Create a new feature branch BEFORE any file changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/descriptive-name
   ```

   - Use kebab-case names with prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, etc.
   - **This MUST happen before creating files, directories, or editing _anything_.**

3. **ðŸ“‹ Initial To-Do List**: Formulate an initial to-do list of the steps you think you need to accomplish the task.

   - If you have a built-in task tracking tool, use that.
   - Otherwise, write your to-do list to a [scratch file](.scratch/) `.scratch/descriptive-name.md`.

4. **âš¡ Implementation**: Only now perform code modifications, file creation, etc.

   - Refer to your to-do list frequently to figure out your next step(s).
     - Update the to-do list as you complete tasks and/or learn new things.
   - Follow existing code conventions and style.
   - **Commit your changes as you go**:
     - Group related changes into logical commits.
     - Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what".

5. **âœ… Verification**: Test and lint before concluding work.

   - Run tests and linters to ensure quality.
   - Verify all issue requirements are met.

6. **ðŸš€ Create Pull Request**: Push your branch and create a pull request.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/descriptive-name
   gh pr create --title "Clear descriptive title" --body "Detailed description"
   ```

   - Include a clear title and detailed description.
   - Reference the GitHub issue being addressed.

## Overview

This project, `dotfilet`, is a declarative configuration management tool for developer environments, initially targeting macOS. It treats your machine's configuration as code, enabling versioning, sharing, and reliable reproduction.

Key characteristics:

- **Declarative**: Define the desired state in CUE configuration files, and `dotfilet` handles the rest.

- **Bi-directional Sync**: Uniquely, it can read manual changes from the system and help you commit them back to your configuration.

- **Extensible**: A plugin system allows for managing various applications and system settings.

For a deeper understanding of the project's design, architecture, and concepts, please refer to the documentation in the [`docs`](./docs/) directory.

## Keeping this Document Updated

This document is a living guide for AI agents working on this project. To ensure future agents can work as efficiently and effectively as possible, it is crucial to keep this document current.

As you work, you will learn new things about the codebase, the tools, and the project's conventions. Please help improve this guide by:

- **Documenting Tool Quirks**: If you discover a non-obvious behavior or a specific way a tool needs to be used, add it to the relevant section (e.g., `Toolchain`).

- **Capturing Implicit Conventions**: If you notice a recurring style or pattern in the code that isn't explicitly documented, add it to the `Style` section or create a new one.

- **Correcting Outdated Information**: If you find that any part of this document is inaccurate or no longer relevant, please correct it immediately.

- **Adding Helpful Information**: If you find yourself repeatedly discovering the same information, consider adding it to this guide to help future agents. This could be a new helpful command, a common workflow, or a link to a useful resource.

Think of this as contributing to the collective knowledge of the team. Your updates will help all future agents get up to speed faster and avoid common pitfalls.

## Issue Tracking

- **Tracked in GitHub**: All work is tracked via GitHub Issues.
  - Use sub-issues to break down larger pieces of work.

- **Issue Templates**: Use an appropriate [issue template]((.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) (such as the [task template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md)) to ensure all necessary information is included.

- **Collaboration**: Use issue comments for notes, ideas, and discussing progress.

## Toolchain

- [Mise](http://mise.jdx.dev/) is used to manage the toolchain.
  - Arbitrary tools can be run via `mise exec -- COMMAND`

    Example: `mise exec -- dprint fmt AGENTS.md`

  - Common tasks are declared via Mise, and are run via `mise run TASK [ARGSâ€¦]`

    - Tasks can be discovered via `mise task ls`, and are defined in [.mise.toml](./.mise.toml)

### Important Tasks

- After editing a file, ALWAYS run `mise run fix-style FILE` to auto-format it.

- To format ALL files in the project, run `mise run fix-style` (without additional arguments).

- To view the merged output of an example: `mise run example-config EXAMPLE-DIR-NAME`.

  Example: `mise run example-config multi-host`

## Style

### Markdown Style

- Write lists using the `-` character.

- Leave a newline between each list item, unless the list is enumerating short items (names, etc).

- **Labeled Lists**: When list items begin with a label, **bold** the text, but leave the `:` outside of the label.

- Use markdown alerts for "asides" and other secondary information. There must always be a blank `>` line between the alert type and body
