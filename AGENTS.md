## Development Workflow

> [!WARNING]
>
> This workflow MUST be followed for every task. Failure to follow this workflow, especially creating a branch before making changes, will result in rejected modifications.

### MANDATORY Steps (In Order):

1. **ðŸ“– Read & Understand**: Thoroughly review the GitHub issue and all comments first.

   - Make sure you understand [the high-level design of this project](docs/Design.md).
   - If it's a sub-issue, review the parent issue and related sub-tasks.
   - Formulate an initial to-do list of the steps you think you need to accomplish the task.
     - If you have a built-in task tracking tool, use that.
     - Otherwise, write your to-do list to a file
   - **NO file system modifications during this step.**

2. **ðŸŒ¿ Create Branch**: Create a new feature branch BEFORE any file changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/descriptive-name
   ```

   - Use kebab-case names with prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, etc.
   - **This MUST happen before creating files, directories, or editing _anything_.**

3. **ðŸ“‹ Initial To-Do List**: Formulate an initial to-do list of the steps you think you need to accomplish the task.

   - If you have a built-in task tracking tool, use that.
   - Otherwise, write your to-do list to a [scratch file](.scratch/) `.scratch/descriptive-name.md`.

4. **âš¡ Implementation**: Only now perform code modifications, file creation, etc.

   - Refer to your to-do list frequently to figure out your next step(s).
     - Update the to-do list as you complete tasks and/or learn new things.
   - Follow existing code conventions and style.
   - **Commit your changes as you go**:
     - Group related changes into logical commits.
     - Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what".

5. **âœ… Verification**: Test and lint before concluding work.

   - Run tests and linters to ensure quality.
   - Verify all issue requirements are met.

6. **ðŸš€ Create Pull Request**: Push your branch and create a pull request.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/descriptive-name
   gh pr create --title "Clear descriptive title" --body "Detailed description"
   ```

   - Include a clear title and detailed description.
   - Reference the GitHub issue being addressed.

## Overview

This project, `dotfilet`, is a declarative configuration management tool for developer environments, initially targeting macOS. It treats your machine's configuration as code, enabling versioning, sharing, and reliable reproduction.

Key characteristics:

- **Declarative**: Define the desired state in CUE configuration files, and `dotfilet` handles the rest.

- **Bi-directional Sync**: Uniquely, it can read manual changes from the system and help you commit them back to your configuration.

- **Extensible**: A plugin system allows for managing various applications and system settings.

For a deeper understanding of the project's design, architecture, and concepts, please refer to the documentation in the [`docs`](./docs/) directory.

## Documentation Maintenance

This document and the entire `docs/` directory serve as living guides for AI agents. Keeping documentation current is essential for project success.

### When to Update Documentation

Update documentation whenever you:

- **Discover new patterns or conventions** not yet documented

- **Find outdated or incorrect information** in any documentation

- **Learn non-obvious tool behaviors** or workarounds

- **Implement architectural changes** that affect the design or concepts

- **Add new features** that change how the system works

### Key Documentation Files

- **[AGENTS](AGENTS.md)** (this file): Agent workflows, toolchain, and conventions

- **[docs/Design](docs/Design.md)**: High-level architecture, concepts, and design decisions

- **[docs/Plugin Protocol](docs/Plugin%20Protocol.md)**: The specification of how Dotfilet core and plugins communicate.

- **[docs/Roadmap](docs/Roadmap.md)**: Future features and ideas that are under consideration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Always update both AGENTS.md and relevant docs/ files when making changes that affect project architecture or workflows.

## Issue Tracking

- **Tracked in GitHub**: All work is tracked via GitHub Issues.
  - Use sub-issues to break down larger pieces of work.

- **Issue Templates**: Use an appropriate [issue template]((.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) (such as the [task template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md)) to ensure all necessary information is included.

- **Collaboration**: Use issue comments for notes, ideas, and discussing progress.

## Toolchain

- [Mise](http://mise.jdx.dev/) is used to manage the toolchain.
  - Arbitrary tools can be run via `mise exec -- COMMAND`

    Example: `mise exec -- dprint fmt AGENTS.md`

  - Common tasks are declared via Mise, and are run via `mise run TASK [ARGSâ€¦]`

    - Tasks can be discovered via `mise task ls`, and are defined in [.mise.toml](./.mise.toml)

### Important Tasks

- After editing a file, ALWAYS run `mise run fix-style FILE` to auto-format it.

- To format ALL files in the project, run `mise run fix-style` (without additional arguments).

- To view the merged output of an example: `mise run example-config EXAMPLE-DIR-NAME`.

  Example: `mise run example-config multi-host`

## Style

### Markdown Style

- Write lists using the `-` character.

- Leave a newline between each list item, unless the list is enumerating short items (names, etc).

- **Labeled Lists**: When list items begin with a label, **bold** the text, but leave the `:` outside of the label.

- Use markdown alerts for "asides" and other secondary information. There must always be a blank `>` line between the alert type and body

  > [!NOTE]

  > Supported alert types:
  >
  > - NOTE
  > - TIP
  > - IMPORTANT
  > - WARNING
  > - CAUTION
